These devices are supposedly built on Yang models so in theory it will help me better understand model driven programmability.

These devices can be managed by Cli or through RPCs:
  * gRPC server
    * gNMI
    * gNOI
  * json/rpc server

So I have gotten json/rpc to work. I've gotten some ospf and interface configurations to apply.  I have been unsuccessful getting ospf to establish a simply adjacency.
The documentation on json/rpc is not bad. However the path formats are wierd and require some trial and error to get correct.
